 STX Raffle Pot Smart Contract

**STX Raffle Pot** is a decentralized and transparent on-chain raffle system built using Clarity on the Stacks blockchain. It allows users to enter a raffle by depositing STX, and a winner is selected pseudo-randomly to receive the accumulated pot.

 Features

-  **Fixed Entry Raffle** â€“ Users enter by sending a predefined STX amount.
-  **On-chain Logic** â€“ All ticketing, pot accumulation, and winner selection are handled by smart contract logic.
-  **Fair Draw Mechanism** â€“ Uses block hash as a basic randomness source for winner selection.
-  **Winner History** â€“ Stores data about each round and the winner's address.
-  **Trustless** â€“ No need for a third party or admin control once deployed.

 How It Works

1. Users enter the raffle by calling `enter-raffle` with the entry fee.
2. Once the number of participants reaches a threshold, or an admin triggers it, `draw-winner` is called.
3. A winner is pseudo-randomly selected using block hash.
4. The total STX pot is transferred to the winner's address.
5. Raffle round resets and opens for the next participants.
